I would like to take this opportunity to apply for the position of ``Senior Software Engineer'' in MeVis Medical Solutions AG. 

I have completed my bachelor of engineering in India and a master degree in communication and information technology at University of Bremen. Since then I have been working as a software developer for simulation and analysis of electromagnetic fields in satellite communication. 

On my current position, one of my designation is to design software and write tests to ensure that a high quality is maintained in the production code and other being the product documentation.

After loosing my father to cancer, the fascinating field of medical imagine has pegged a curiosity in me and I am quite confident that with my qualification I am able to contribute fully to the requirements of MeVis Medical Solutions AG.

I would be very glad to hear from you and will take this opportunity as a personal one.
